# swiftTMDB

An iOS usecase app in searching, fetching and displaying movies using the Movie Database API.

This project explores MVVM in architecture, showcasing the separation of concerns between the view and the view model, testability by using abstraction and data encapsulation.

Written in Swift 6 and using UIKit.



### Note:

You cannot run the app directly. You need to create a free account in [the Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org) and get your API Read Access token key from account settings and add in in DataAPI().

If you want to check the app without the registering, check it in [Testflight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/1cfsc72Z)
